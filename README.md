Translator's pack for Randall Munroe's _xkcd 1190: Time_. Free for anyone who wants it, but the original license for xkcd applies.

Resources are 3 times as big as the original, because I upscaled them a bit in hopes of making it better to work with.

currently missing from translation overlay: frame 2900 is giving me some headache to clean away the text
