This is what you want if you came for the translator's pack. The file names for each overlay correspond to the frame. Unless there is a mistake, it means that only these overlays have (or rather: cover) English text. Beanish has not been taken into account. 

This was done manually (and with the help of the Resynthesizer plugin for GIMP), which comes with some disadvantages, such as not being as optimised in file size as possible, and gradients possibly being messed up.

Only text got overlayed, any "speech bubble" line remains intact.
